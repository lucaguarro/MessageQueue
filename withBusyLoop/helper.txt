To kill 251.out we write "kill -10 <pid>" in a separate terminal

To delete all messages in queues, run: ipcrm --all=msg

ipcs to check message queues

to see all running processes: ps -aux | less

int qid = msgget(ftok(".",'u'), IPC_EXCL|IPC_CREAT|0600); to try and create message queue no matter what. Returns -1 if already created.
int qid = msgget(ftok(".",'u'), IPC_CREAT|0600); to create message queue if it doesnt exist. If it already does, just saves a reference to it.

order to run programs:
1. RecieverA will halt when it tries to receive a message from 997 or 251
2. Sender997 should make receiverA receive one message at this point. Will halt until receiverB starts.
3. Sender251 will make receiverA start receiving messages
4. sender257 will send messages to receiverB
5. recieverB
